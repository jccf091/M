<title>intro
:To calculate the area under a graph above x-axis of a function, we use a method called integration.
<img>
:The term integral can be used to refer to two types of integrals
<maths>
:1.indefinite integral
<maths>
:Indefinite integral is also known as antiderivative. The antiderivative of a function, f(x), is simply another function, A(x), whose derivative is f(x).
<maths>
:It is the simply undoing differenication.
<maths>
:2.definite integral
<maths>
:Definite integral is basically the area under a graph above x-axis of a function between  an interval [a,b].
<maths>
:Here is a more formal defintion.

<title>indefinite integral
:To compute the indefinite integral of a function, we need to undo the differiciation. Here are certain techniques we can use.
<maths>
:1.using identies: Here is a list of equations that will help when it comes to indefinite integration.

:2.using the sum rule:
<img>
:3.using the constant factor rule
<img>
:4.reversing the product rule
<img>
:4.u-substitution
<img>
:5.using partial fractions expansion
<img>
:One thing we need to take note off when undoing the differiciation is that, we will actually get a infinite number of functions.
<maths>
:Difffericing a constant will give us 0 in the differeication and thus the final result after antidifferication will always be in this form
<maths>
:We use C here to represent a consant and it can be any constant. And it wil be gone after differenicating the function.
<maths>

<title>definite integral
:To compute the definite intergral of a function, we just subtract the indefinite integral with a as x by the indefinite integral with b as x
<img>
:Unlike indefinite integration, we will not get an infinite number of number after definite integration, because the constant C will be canceled out after subtraction.
