<title>Introduction
:Integers are any number that is not fractional. Integer = whole number.
<img>integer
:Primes (or prime numbers) are positive integers that can only be divided two numbers: 1 and itself [without giving remainder or decimal].
<maths>prime
<title>Prime factorisation
:Factorizing a number would mean finding what positive integers the number can be divided by.
<maths>fact1
:To fully factorize a number, our final result should be a group of prime numbers.

<title>HCF and LCM
:After fully factorizing two numbers 
:E.g. 12, 16
<maths>fact3
:we can find their highest common factor (HCF) and lowest common multiple (LCM).
<n>
:1.Highest common factoe is the biggest number that these two numbers can be divided by.
<img>HCF
:To find the HCF, we have to check and see what prime factors these two number share:
<maths>fact4
:Multiplying them together would give the HCF.
<maths>fact5
<n>
:2.Lowest common multiple is the smallest number that can be divided by these two numbers.
<img>LCM
:To find the LCM, we too have to check and see what prime factors these two number share:
<maths>fact4
:And then just multiply all prime factors together but leave out the common factors:
<maths>fact6
:This is the same as to multipying these two number and divide the product by the HCF:
<maths>fact7

<title>Sqaure Root
:When a number can be written as the product of two same numbers, we called it a perfect square.
<maths>prefectness
:We can find a perfect square's square root after facotrising it. 
<maths>fact8
<maths>fact9
<maths>factz1
:The symobl in front of 12 means that the answer can be either positive 12 or negative 12.
<maths>factz2
:That is because multiplying -12 by itself can give us 144 too.
<maths>factz3

:And this applies to all positive numbers, so all positive numbers have two square roots, one positive, the other one negative.
<n>
<title>Cube Root
:We can also find the cube root of a perfect cube after factorising it.
<maths>fact10
<maths>fact11
<maths>factz5
:Unlike suqare root, there is only one cube root for all numbers.
<maths>factz6
:Multiplying a negative number three times does not give us a positive number.
