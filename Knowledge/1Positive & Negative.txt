<title>Division
:1.Negative divides by positive = negative.

:You can imagine it as putting a negative amount of things into a positive amount of portions
<maths>Ndi1
:2.Positive divides by negative = negative
<maths>Ndi4
:You can imagine it as putting a positive amount of things into a negative amount of portions. Since the positive amount of things does not come in negative form, dividing them into negative amount of portions will result in lacking of things in each porition.
<maths>Ndi3
:3.Negative divides by negative = positive.
<maths>Ndi6
:You can imagine it as putting a negative amount of things into a negative amount of portions. Since negative amount of things comes in negative form, dividing them into negative amount of portions will result in having enough amount of things in each porition.
