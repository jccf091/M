<title>Introduction
:A changing quantity is a value that changes over time. One example of changing quantity is the memoery in your iPhone.

:Another example would be the HP of a video game character.

<title>Ratio
:Ratio is a way to show the relationship between two or more changing quantities.

:Imagine you are Bill Gates and 1 second you can make $500.
<img>billgate
:You can write it down as a ratio.
<maths>5000
:In 2 seconds, you would have $1000. You can aslo write that down as a ratio.
<maths>100000
:The ratio 1000:2 is equivalent to 500:1.
<maths>equal
:That is because when we are writing a ratio, we are just writing down a relationship between the two changing quantities.
<maths>2values
:The ratios 500:1 and 1000:2 both display the same relationship.
<img>whatitallmeans
:We would prefer to write the relationship as 500:1 though, because 500:1 is in its simplest form.
<maths>simple
<title>Simplest form
:As long as there is no common prime factor between the two values, and the values are not fractions, the ratio is in its simplest form.

:Although normally nobody would write ratio in fractions, there is no rule saying it can't be done. But we should always convert it into its simplest form.

<title>rate
:A rate is a ratio between two changing quanities that are in different units.
<maths>differentunit
:The ratio above, 1:500, is a rate because 1 and 500 are in different units(dollar & second). It can be futher written as
<maths>furtherwritten
:Speed is also a rate. And the ratio above can also be considered as a speed. However, in mathematics speed is normally thought of as a distance per unit time.

<title>Speed
:Speed is defined as the ratio between a changing qunaity (normally distance) and time.
<maths>speed
:Therefore any speed is also a rate and it can be rewritten as
