:We are living in a 3D (3 dimensional) world, where there are length, width and height.

:Things we draw on a paper can be considered 2D (2 dimensional). They has no height. However... [Read More]

technically speaking, the things that we draw has height (the ink itself on the papaer has height). But we still like to call it 2 dimensional because when we talk about the drawing on a peice of paper we are not concerned about the height of the ink (the height is too insignificant);
:Real 2D objects can never exist in a 3D space. They can only exist in an imaginary 2D space known as "a plane".

:A plane is a space with only 2 dimensions (length and width, but no height).

:To calculate the perimeter of a figure, we just need to add up all the side lengths.

:In geometry, a prism is basically a solid with two opposite ends that are parallel to each other and same in shape, connected straightly by sides that are flat (unless it is a cylinder).
