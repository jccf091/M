<title>Introduction
:Angle is a figure formed by two lines (called the sides of the angle), sharing a common endpoint (called the vertex of the angle)

:The size of angle would not change even if its sides increase or decrease in length

<title>Basic types
:Angles can be classified according to their sizes. There are mainly 4 types:
<n>
:1.acute angle: angles smaller than 90 degrees.
<img>acuteangle
:2.right angle: angles that are 90 degrees.
<img>rightangle
:3.obtuse angle: angles bigger than 90 degrees but smaller than 180 degress.

:4.reflex angle: angles bigger than 180 degrees.

:Angles can also be classified according to how they relate to one another.
<n>
:Complementary angles: two angles that add up to 90degrees
<img>complementary
:Supplementary angles: two angles that add up to 180degrees
<img>supplementary
:Vertically opposite angles: two angles with same degree but opposite one another.

:Adjacent angles: Angles that share a side.

<title>Angles formed when there is a polygon
<img>pologonn
:Interior angles: angles inside a polygon
<img>interior
:To find the sum of interior angles sizes in a polygon, we can use this formula:
<maths>interiorx
:Exterior angles: angles formed by extending the sides of polygon
<img>exteriorx
:The sum of exterior angles is always 180 degrees.

<title>Angles formed by transversal
:A transversal is a line that passes through two parallel lines at different points.

<title>Corresponding angle
:Corresponding angles are 2 angles of which one is above the other. They have the same size.
<img>corres
:There are in total 4 pairs of them.

<title>Alternate interior angle
:Alternate interior angles are 2 angles that is in the Z shape. They have same degree.
<img>altei
:There are 2 pairs of them, the other pairs exist in the reverse Z shape.

<title>Alternate external angle
:Alternate external angles are angles that are are the furthest away from each other. They have same degree.
<img>alterx
:One of them is actually just the vertically opposite angle of the other's corresponding angle.
<img>alterxx
:There are in total 2 pairs of them.

<title>Consecutive interior angle
:Consecutive interior angles are angles that are inside a region. They add up together 180 degrees.
<img>consec
:There are only 2 pairs of them.
