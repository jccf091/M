<title>Polygon
:A polygon is a flat shape consisting of straight lines that are joined to form a closed chain.

:When we talk about different types of polygon, we are mostly concerned about the shapes (but not the sizes).
<img>onlyshapes
:Two figures can be viewed as the exact same polygon, even when one is bigger than the other.

<title>Basic types

<title>Simple polygons
:Simple polygons are polygons with sides that do not overlap. Its oppoiste is complex polygons.

:Simple polygons can be further classified into different types.

<title>Triangle
:Triagnle are simple polygons with three straight lines as sides.

<title>Quadrangle (or Quadrilateral)
:Quadrangles are simple polygons with four straight lines as sides.

<title>Square
:Squares are basically the combination of rhombus and rectangles: all sides eqaul in length with two pair of sides parellel.

<title>Convex polygon
:Convex polygons are simple polygons with all internal angles less than 180 degrees.

<title>Concave polygon
:Concave polygons are simple polygons with one or more internal angle more than 180 degrees.

<title>Regular polygons
:Regular polygons are simple polygons that have all angles equal in sides and all sides eqaul in length
<img>regular
<title>Pentagon
:Pentagons are five-sided regular polygon.

<title>Hexagon
:Hexagons are six-sided polygon with all sides eqaul in length.

<title>Circle
:The more sides a regular polygon has, the more it looks like a circle. Actually, as the number of sides a regular polygon approaches infinite, its shape becomes a circle.
