<title>intro
:In mathematics, a plane is a flat, 2D surface.
<img>plane
:When coordinates are used to specify each point uniquely in a plane, that plane is a Cartesian plane.

<title>graph of equation
:The graph of an equation is a collection of points. Each point is a representation of a possible pair of values for x and y that can fit in the equation.
<img> 
:Therefore we can say that the graph displays the relationship between the variables x and y in the equation.
<img>
:A graph normally exists on a Cartesian plane (a plane with coordinates).
<img>
:We can specify a particular point in the line formed by the graph by writing down its x and y coordinates.
<img>
:x always comes first, then it is y.
<maths>
<title>graph of an linear equation
:When the equation does not have exponente higher than 1, the graph (in other words, the collection of points) forms a straight line.
<img>
:That is also why equations with no exponent higher than 1 are known as linear equations.
<img>
<title>steepness of the line
:The steepness of the line depends on how the value of y changes as we change the value of x.
<img>
:How the value of y changes as we change the value of x depends on the factor of y as to x.
<img>
:The bigger the factor, the more upward the line points.
<img>
:The smaller the factor, the more downward the line points.
<img>
:When the factor is positive, the line will always point upward.
<img>
:When the factor is negative, the line will always point downward.
<img>
:Since the factor is actually controlling the degree of steepness, it is often referred to as the gradient (or slope) of the graph.
<img>
:And we can conclude that the graident of a graph tells us how the value of x changes as we changes the value of y.
<img>
:When two lines are parallel, each of their y changes according to their corresponding x the same way as each other.
<img>
:and therefore they have the same graident, in other words, their values of m are the same.
<img>
:What makes these two lines different is their position.
<img>
:Their position is governed by a value known as the y-intercept.
<img>
:Actually all liner equations can be written in this form and c is the y-intercept (and m is the gradient):
<maths>
:The graph will intercept y-axis at c and therefore c is known as the y-intercept.
