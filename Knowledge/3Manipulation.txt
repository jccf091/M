:We can rewrite an expression in a way that it will still express the same value.
<maths>rewrite
:By writing an expression in an entirely different way, we are manipulating it.
<maths>mani
:We can simplify an expression by manipulating it 
<maths>sim
:Or expand an expression:
<maths>expa
:But before we start manipulating an expression, we have to keep certain things in mind.
<img>mind
:First thing is that, when letters are in an expressions like this:
<maths>multx1
:we prefer to omit the multiplcation sign and write it as
<maths>multx2
:If there is a number in the multiplcation:
<maths>multx3
:we need to place the number in front of the letter:
<maths>multx4
:but not behind the letter:
<maths>multx5
<img>no
:Second thing is that, divison should always be written as a fraction
<maths>di1
:Trust me, things would be easier this way when we start manipulating the expression.
<maths>di2
:And this way we can change a division into a multiplcation
<maths>di3
<titile>basic manipulation
:To manipulate an expression, we should start off by seeing everything in the expression as different blocks of symbols.
<img>blocks
<img>blockit
:When two blocks consist of the same factor, addition and subtraction can take place.
<maths>addb1
<maths>addb2
:When the addition or subtraction does not give a single value result, we can write them in brackets
<maths>addb4
<maths>addb3
:And thus expressions that have a bracket like this can be expanded
<maths>brac
:Addition and subtraction can also take place when two fraction have the same denominator.
<maths>deno
:When two blocks that made up of a fraction consist of the same factor, we can factorise it.
<maths>fracts
:That is because dividing the value by the same value is equal to 1.
<maths>bbc
<maths>bbc2
:So if the two values are different, we can still do the same trick, but we would not get 1.
<maths>bbc3
<title>slightly advanced manipulation
:In order to simplify expressions that are slightly complex,
<maths>complx
<maths>complx2
:we need to be more observant and spot the keys to the simplification.
<img>eyes
:These are two very important equations that we should always keep in mind:
<maths>eq1
<maths>eq2
:When we have brackets with a lot of things in it,
<maths>lots
:remember that we should always "do each and single one of them" as we expand it.
<maths>expa
:When we have two fractions multiplying by each another,
<maths>twofrac
:"top floor X top floor, bottom floor X bottom floor"
<maths>twofrac2
:But when we have two fracctions one dividing the other,
<maths>twofrac3
:we should always change it into a multiplcation by flipping either one of it:
<maths>twofrac4
<maths>twofrac5
:When the expression is consist of two fractions with different denominators
<maths>diffde
:addition and subtraction can still take place but we have to first convert them into fractions with the same denominators:
<maths>diffde2
