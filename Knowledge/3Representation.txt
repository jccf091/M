<title>intro
:We human like to represent things with symbols.
:One example would be the Arabic numerals.
<img>number
:They are just symbols representing values. 
<maths>sre
:When you see 6 and 1, you would know their values immediately and you can also tell that adding them up will give the value of 7. 
<img>61
:But imagine this: when you were young, you were taught that this symbol "6" does not represent the value 6. Instead, you were taught that this symbol "6" represent the value 3. 
<maths>re1
<maths>re2
<maths>re3
:And then 6+1=7 wouldn't make any sense to you, 6+1 should equal to 4.
<maths>og
:Representating a value using a symbol is the concept of representation.
<title>algebra representation
:In elementary algebra, besides representing already known values with numeral, we also use letters (or other symbols) to represent values that are not known or not determined.
<img>letters
:Sometimes the letter in the eqaution represents a fixed value:
<maths>a15
<maths>a15o
:But sometimes they represent multiple values.
<maths>ab
:The letters "y" and "t" each can represent any value as long as they add up together equal to 100.
<maths>ab2
:We can say that "y" and "t" share a relationship and the relationship is that when they add up together it is eqaul to 100.
<title>expressions
:In mathematics, expression is anything that expresses a value. The value does not have to be a fixed value.
<img>expressions
:We use symbols to represent values and so the symbols express those values and are called an expression.
<maths>expr
:Sometimes an expression may express a fixed value only when there is an equation.
<img>exprx
:In different eqaution it may express a different value.
<maths>exprxx
:Expressions can be in any length and made up of different symbols. It is an expression as long as it expresses a value.
<maths>explong
:There is no rule saying that an expression has to express a fixed value.
<maths>notfixed
