<title>Intro
:A set is basically a collection of objects.
<img>collection
:A song album, for example, can be thought of as a set of songs.
<img>album
:We can use the letter A to represent the entire album, and different numbers to represent the songs in the album. 1 represents the first song, 2 represents the second song... This set of songs can be expressed this way:
<maths>set
:1,2,3,4,5,6 are elements (or "members") of A.
<n>
:To express if an object is an element of A, we can use the element symbols.
<maths>elemz
<maths>elenoo
:To express the total number of elements in a A, we can write
<maths>setnum
:One thing to take note of is that a set can't have duplicate element.
<maths>setnot
<img>no
:That is because in set theory, we only concern about the types of things in a set, but not the quantities.
<n>
:When a set has no element, it is called an empty set. B here is an empty set.
<maths>empty
<n>

<title>Subset and superset
:When we have 2 sets (A and B) and A has every element B has,
<img>vienn
:we can say that B is a subset of A.
<maths>subset
:We can even say that B is a proper subset of A because A has element that B doesn't have.
<maths>Psubset
:If A has the exact same elements as B, that means A = B. And B is a subset of A, and A is also a subset of B, but not a proper subset of B.

:As long as the condition is satisfied, one set is a subset of another set. And this means a set is always a subset of itself.
<maths>itself
:The opposite of subset is superset. The notation is just the inverted version of subset.
<maths>super
:Writing A is the superset of B is the same as saying B is the subset of A.
<title>Universal set & Exclusion
:In set theory,  a universal set is a set which contains all objects that we are concern.
<img>univs
:The set of objects that is outside of A but inside of the universal set can be expressed as
<maths>compl
:This set is called the complement of set A. The notation ' simply means excluding all objects in a particular set.
