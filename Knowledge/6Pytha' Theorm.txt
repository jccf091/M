<hide>we don't normally say that "1+1=2" is a theroem because the word "theorm" is usually used to describe mathematical statement that is not so self-evident (whose proofs are not trivial). However, from a certain mathematical point of view, or rather, in certain system of axioms, "1+1=2" may not appear to be self-evident, and thus can be viewed as a theorm. It actually took two famous mathematicians, Russell and Whitehead, more than 300 pages to prove that "1+1=2", in the book Principia Mathematica, because it is viewed in a particular system of axioms that requires it to have a long proof.
<hide>Just an extra note here: Other than looking at "1+1=2" as a mathematical statement which says that the value "1+1" is equivalent to the value of "2", we can also look at it as a definition of the symbol "2" (that "2" is defined as the addition of "1" and "1").

<title>Pythagoras' theorem
:One of the most important theorems in trigonometry is the Pythagoras' theorem.
<img>pytha
:Pythagoras' theorem states that for all right triangles, the longest side length's square is equal to the sum of the other two side lengths' squares.
<img>trigp
:This equation works as long as it is a right triangle.
<img>
:For non-right triangle, we use the cosine-rule instead of the pythagoras' theorem.

<title>Applications
:With the pythagoras' theorem, we can work out one side length of the triangle, when some informations are given:
