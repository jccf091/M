<title>Trigonometric functions
:A trigonometric function is basically a function that takes in a triangle's angle as input and outputs a fraction with one side length of that triangle as numerator and another side length as denominator.

<title>Sine, Cosine and tangents
:Different trigonometric functions outputs different fractions. The basic trigonometric functions are the sine, cosine and tangent.

<maths>sin
<maths>cos
<maths>tan
:To remember them, you can either use this mnemonic (mnemonic is a device that ):
<maths>
:Or just follow these steps...
<b>
:1) hypotenuse is the longest word, so it refers to the longest side.
<img>
:2) now think of sine and cosine as a couple, and they are over-hyper (over hypotenuse)
<img>
:3) Now recall the song gangdam style.
<img>
:"Op op oppa gangham style!"
:Op always comes first, and so sine, the first function, would have opp (opposite) first in the fraction, then followed by hypotenuse because she is over-hyper. Meanwhile, cosine would be the other possible combo, which is adjacent / hypotenuse.
<img>
:4) Now think of tan as some suntan guy. He is not hyper at all.
<img>
:"Op op oppa gingham style!"
:Op always comes first, so tan has opp over something, and the something must be adjacent (He is not even hyper, so he is not over-hyper at all.)
<img>
:Conclusion: You have a couple who are over-hyper and a suntan guy. And "Op" always comes first.
<b>
:If you are having a hard time remembering which side "Adjacent" refers to, just find the side that is not opposite of the angle and also not the longest and highlight it with a hightlighter.
<img>
:This way would make things less confusing and you will be able to spot the adjacent side instantly.

<title>Important trigonometric identities
:Since sine and cosine is a couple, they have a very strong relationship:
<img>
<maths>Sine(x) = Cosine (90-x)
:Therefore because 
<maths>Sin(90) = 1
:We can tell that
<maths>Cos(0) = 1.
:And because
<maths>sin(0) = 0,
:We can also derive that
<maths>Cos(90) = 0
:The same goes to
<maths>sin(30) = 0.5 cos(60) = 0.5
:Sin() any value outputs the same result as cos(90 - the value).
:The mathematical reason behind it is:
<img>
<n>
:This couple's relationship is so strong that sometimes it seems magical:
<maths>sin(a)^2+cos(a)^2 = 1
:The mathematical reason behind it is:
<img>
<n>
:One thing you should always remember about the sun tan guy is that he is really strange:
<img>
<maths>tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x)
:The mathematical reason behind it is:
<img>
<n>
<title>Applying trigonometric function
:We can use the trigonometric function to find the side length of a triangle.
<img>
:We can also use it to 
find the area of a triangle.
<maths>1/2 ab sin C
:The mathematical reason behind it is:

<title>inverse trigo functions
:If you are given the sides of the triangle and you want to find the angle, the inverse trigo functions should be used:
<img>
<maths>sin^-1(a) =
<maths>cos^-1(a) =
<maths>tan^-1(a) = 
:The inverse trigo functions can also be written by placing "arc" at the start of the word: arcsine, arccosine, arctangent.
:Do not confuse this with exponential. x^-1 doesn't mean "inversing power". x^-1 = 1/x
<title> other trigo functions
:Besides sine, cosine, tangent, there are other trigo functions as well:
<maths>cotangent = adjacent / opposite;
<maths>secant = hypotenuse/opposite/
<maths>cosecant = hypotenuse / adjacent
:They are like the shadow of the basic trigonometry functions:
<maths>cot(a) = 1/tan(a)
<maths>cse(a) = 1/sin(a)
<maths>sec(a) = 1/cos(a)
:And this also means
<maths>cot^-1(a) = 1/tan^-1(a)
<maths>cse^-1 = 1/sin^-1(a)
<maths>sec^-1 =  1/cos^-1(a)
