<title>trigonometry rules
:Trigonometry rules are equation that shows the relationship between different sides and angles in a triangle.

<title>Sine rule

<title>Cosine rule

:The cool thing about cosine rule is that, when c is 90 degree, you'd have a right-angle triangle and it actually becomes the Pythagorus' theorem.

:Therefore cosine rule can be considered as a generalization of pythagorus' theorem. (Cosine rule can be applied to all triangles. But pythagorus' theorem can only be applied to right-triangles)
