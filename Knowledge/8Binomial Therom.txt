:A binomial is a polynomial with two terms.

<title>Binomial theorom
:Binomial theorom is a mathematical statement about the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial.
<maths>binom
<maths>bic
:This theorem shows that we can expand the power of a+b into a sum according to a formula as long as the exponent is a positive integer:
<maths>bf
:Actually, this theorm is describing the pattern that can be oberserved when we expand any power of a+b 
<maths>bi1
<maths>bi2

<maths>bi4
<maths>bi5
:The pattern is that when we expand the n power of (a+b), we start off by writing x to the power of n
<maths>bpattern
:Then x to the power of (n-1), with y to the power of 1, and a coefficent n
<maths>bpattern2
:Then x to the power of (n-2), with y to the power of 2, and a corresponding coefficent
<maths>bpattern3
:Then x to the power of (n-3), with y to the power of 3, and a corresponding coefficent
<maths>bpattern4
:This goes all the way (x's power minus by 1 for each time) until x's power becomes 0 and y acheives the power of n.
<maths>
:One thing to remember is that the coefficent starts decrease when y's power is bigger than x

:We can actually even spot the beautiful symmetry here!
