<title>intro
:A polynomial is an expression constructed from indeterminates and constants, using only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents.
<maths>poly1
:Division of constant is allowed though, because it is equivalent to multiplication by a constant fraction.
<maths>poly2
:But division of indeterminates is never allowed in a polynomial. 
<maths>poly3
:Square root and any other root are too not allowed. They are the same as having non-integer exponents which are too not allowed.
<maths>poly4
:In a polynomail, different elements have their own speical names.

<title>Polynomial division.
:Polynomial division is pretty much the same as normal division, but we have keep in mind that there are different terms in the division.
<maths>diffterm
:To accomplish a polynomial division, we need to start off by arranging the terms in the polynomial in a descending order.
<maths>polyformate
:If after the arrangement a term with certain degree has been skipped, we need to add in that term of certain degree with 0 as the coefficient.
<maths>polyadd
:Once the terms are in the correct arrangement, we can begin dividing one polynomial by another polynomial.
<maths>polyd1
:First, we put everything in the long division format.
<maths>polyd2
:Then, divide the first term of the dividend by the highest term of the divisor
<img>polyd3
:Multiply the divisor by the result just obtained
<img>polyd4
:And subtract it from the first 2 terms of the dividend
<img>polyd5
:Obtain the result and go on repeating until we get the final values
<img>polyd6
<img>polyd7
:We can write the final values in an equation with quotient and divisor as products and remainder as the value that has to be added.
<maths>polydone
:And this is the same as rewriting an arithmetic division this way:
<maths>equari
<title>remainder theoroem
:The remainder theorem is a mathematical statement stating that the remainder of a polynomial divided by a linear divisor x-c is equal to the value we get when we plug c into the polynomial.
<img>remain1
:Here is a way to show that this theorem is correct:
!1.We let f(x) to be the function of the dividend polynomial
<maths>remain2
!2.and let d(x) to be the function of the quotient polynomail
<maths>reamin3
!3.And thus we can transform the equation into:
<maths>remain4
!4.When we make x = a, we can see that f(a) = r.

<title>factor theorem
:The factor theorem is a mathematical statement stating that if k is the root of a polynomial, (x-k) is a factor of the polynomail.
<img>fa1
:That is because if after a polynomial division, the remainder is 0, the divsor and the quotient are the factors of the dividend.
<img>fa2
:If a polynomail is a factor of another polynomail, it would be able to be divded by that polynomail no matter what the value of x is.
