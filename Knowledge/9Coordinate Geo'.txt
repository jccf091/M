<title>intro
:In mathematics, a plane is a flat, 2D surface.
<img>
:When coordinates are used to specify each point uniquely in a plane, that plane is a Cartesian plane.

<title>Coordinate geometry
:Coordinate geometry is simply a branch of geometry that concerns more with graphs on coordinate planes, mainly the Cartesian plane.

<title>Finding equation for striaght line
:To find the equation of a striaght line, we just need to know the coordinates of two points on it
<img>
:Using these two coordinates, we can first find the graident of the line:
<maths>
:Then we just need to find the y-intercept, and we are done.
<maths>
:The final equation should always be in this form:

<title>Finding length for line segment
:A line segment is just a line that is bounded by two distinct end points
<img>
:To find the length of it, we just use the Pythagors' theoreom
<img>
<title>Finding the midpoint of line segment
:The x-coordinate of the midpoint is the average of the x-coordinates of the two endpoints and the same goes to the y-coordinate.
