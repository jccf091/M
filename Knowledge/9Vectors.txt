<title>introduction
:To better understand what a vector is, we need to know what a plane and Cartesian coorindate system are.
<n>
:A plane is a two-dimensional space (a space with only length and width).

:When coordinates are used to specify each point uniquely in a plane, we have made the entire thing into a coordinate system. This coordinate system is known as a Cartesian coordinate system.

:In geometry, a vector is bascially a qunaity wih two independent properties: magnitude and direction.

:A vector can be visulized as just a line with an arrow.

:A force, for example, is a vector. It has both magnitude (how strong it is) and direction (where it is going).
